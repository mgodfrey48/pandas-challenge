# School Data Analysis

The code in this repository qenerates various reports using student data from a school district. The reports are broken down by school, grade, top and bottom performing schools, test scores by school size, and test scores by school type.

To produce the analysis on your computer:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. In the PyCitySchools directory, open `PyCityShools_starter.ipynb` in a jupyter notebook and run the code in each cell
3. If you would like to see two insights I found from the data analysis, open `PyCitySchools_Analysis.txt` in a text editor.
